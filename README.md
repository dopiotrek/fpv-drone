# DIY FPV Drone Build

This repository documents my journey building a 5-inch Analog Freestyle Drone from scratch.

## Project Goals
- Build a flyable quadcopter within a ~200 EUR budget.
- Learn about FPV drone components, soldering, and configuration.
- Use this repository as a "Lab Notebook" to track research and build logs.

## Current Status
- [ ] Phase 1: Research (`01_research`)
- [ ] Phase 2: Frame Assembly (`02_frame`)
- [ ] Phase 3: Stack & Soldering (`03_stack`)
- [ ] Phase 4: Configuration (`04_config`)
- [ ] Phase 5: Maiden Flight (`05_maiden`)

## Directory Structure
- `01_research`: Research notes, wiring diagrams, parts breakdown.
- `02_frame`: Frame assembly logs.
- `03_stack`: Flight controller & soldering logs.
- `04_config`: Betaflight backups and VTX tables.
- `05_maiden`: Maiden flight logs.
- `BOM.md`: Bill of Materials.
