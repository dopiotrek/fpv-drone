# FPV Drone

This repository documents my journey building a 5-inch Analog Freestyle Drone from scratch.

## Project Goals
- Build a flyable quadcopter within a ~200 EUR budget.
- Learn about FPV drone components, soldering, and configuration.
- Use this repository as a "Lab Notebook" to track research and build logs.

## Current Status
- [ ] Phase 1: Discovery (`01_discovery`)
- [ ] Phase 2: Design (`02_design`)
- [ ] Phase 3: Prototyping (`03_build`)
- [ ] Phase 4: Verification (`04_test`)

## Directory Structure
- `01_discovery`: Requirements, constraints, parts selection.
- `02_design`: Wiring diagrams, pinouts, schematics.
- `03_build`: Assembly logs (frame, stack, soldering).
- `04_test`: Configuration backups, VTX tables, maiden flight logs.
- `BOM.md`: Bill of Materials.
